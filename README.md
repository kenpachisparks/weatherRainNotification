This code will ask for a zip code or city name and automate opening Weather.com

The website loads, inputs what you searched, if the city or zip input exists. Then webscraps for rain chances and checks if the rain chance exceeds an amount I sent to 20% then the code saves that to an array then split it up and texts me the information. If there is no rain days, the script runs until it is found.
